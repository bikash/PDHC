2015-10-27 07:41:29,003 WARN  security.ShellBasedIdMapping (ShellBasedIdMapping.java:reportDuplicateEntry(132)) - 
Got multiple ids associated with the same name: new entry (11502, hdfs), existing entry: (11501, hdfs).
The new entry is to be ignored for the following reason.
NFS gateway could have problem starting with duplicate name or id on the host system.
This is because HDFS (non-kerberos cluster) uses name as the only way to identify a user or group.
The host system with duplicated user/group name or id might work fine most of the time by itself.
However when NFS gateway talks to HDFS, HDFS accepts only user and group name.
Therefore, same name means the same user or same group. To find the duplicated names/ids, one can do:
<getent passwd | cut -d: -f1,3> and <getent group | cut -d: -f1,3> on Linux systems,
<dscl . -list /Users UniqueID> and <dscl . -list /Groups PrimaryGroupID> on MacOS.
